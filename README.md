# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the project work for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.

The goal of the project is to collect and clean raw data to produce a tidy data set that can 
be used for later analysis.

## Install
The raw data for this project is obtained by downloading:

   https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

A full description of the data is found at:

   http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Once you download the zip file above, extract it to sub-folder:

   ./UCI HAR Dataset

Where the parent folder is the working directory in R. 

For example, if your folder hierarchy looks like:

	C:\data_science\project\UCI HAR Dataset

Then use:

	setwd("C:/data_science/project")
